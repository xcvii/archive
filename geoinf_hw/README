Projects written as assignments for my various geoinformatics-related
courses. When finished, the following applications should be included:

  * BajaGIS:  A very basic geographic information system supporting mainly
              layered 2D vector graphics editing. It is (being) written in
              C++/Qt

  * AutoGRef: An automatic geo-referencing application which takes two TIFF
              images of the same territory as input -- one geo-referenced,
              the other not -- and tries to geo-reference the second image
              based on the first using a chip-matching technique. Part of
              the task is to write a TIFF parser/renderer from scratch.
              This one is (being) written in Haskell.
