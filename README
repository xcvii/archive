Apple Pickers is a (non-interactive) simulation that aims to answer the
question of what would happen if Sir Isaac Newton, Wilhelm Tell, Snow White and
Eve, Mother of all Living met in the same apple orchard.

It is written as a school assignment for a component-based development
course.  Technologies used are Qt Quick and C++ for the server and graphical
front-end; Haskell for the clients and XML over TCP for communication.

This assignment is already presented, and I don't intend to work on it any
further. Also, this isn't a nice piece of software, it contains several pretty
nasty hacks, so I don't recommend using it for any purpose (; I'm only keeping
it for its novelty value.
