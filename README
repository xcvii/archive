Apple Pickers is a (non-interactive) simulation that aims to answer the
question of what would happen if Sir Isaac Newton, Wilhelm Tell, Snow White and
Eve, Mother of all Living met in the same apple orchard.

It is (being) written as a school assignment for a component-based development
course.  Technologies used are Qt Quick and C++ for the server and graphical
front-end; Haskell for the clients and XML-RPC for the communication.
