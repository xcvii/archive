Goldwasser-Kilian elliptic curve primality proving algorithm
------------------------------------------------------------

This is an implementation of the Goldwasser-Kilian ECPP algorithm written as an
assignment for an algebraic geometry course.  The implementation currently is
not very efficient due to a major and a minor bottleneck:

* To compute the order of an elliptic curve, I'm currently using the naive
  approach which involves iterating over the elements of the field over which
  the curve is given.  The correct way would be to implement Schoof's algorithm
  which can very efficiently produce the order, but this algorithm is much more
  complicated in itself than the rest of the ECPP.

* I'm not using any probabilistic primality testing techniques to optimise away
  the testing of very efficiently provably composite numbers.  (In fact the
  algorithm will sometimes go as far as testing /even/ numbers).  This,
  however, doesn't add nearly as much overhead as the order finding algorithm,
  so I don't think it has a priority.
